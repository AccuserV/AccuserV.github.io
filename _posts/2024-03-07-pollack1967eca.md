> Pollak, Robert A. "Additive von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions." _Econometrica_ 35.3/4 (1967): 485-494.

Axiomatically **characterize** the class of (log-)additive *utility functions* with axioms on *preferences*.
# Definitions and notations
## Utility function forms
A vNM utility functionis *ordinally* *additive* if there exist $T$ functions $v^t(x_t)$ and a twice differentiable function $F$, $F'>0$, such that $F[V(X)]=\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T} v^t(x_t)$.
- A log-additive utility function is ordinally additive.
## Alternatives: lottery tickets
Let $X_a,Y_a$ be $T$-dimensional vector representing *consumption paths*:$X_a=(x_{a1},...,x_{aT}), Y_a=(y_{a1},...,y_{aT})$, and let $\gamma_a\in[0,1]$ be a number. 
A *simple lottery ticket* $L_a=(\gamma_a,X_a,Y_a)$ is an alternative that, once chosen, yields $X_a$ with probability $\gamma_a$ and $Y_a$ with probability $1-\gamma_a$.
$$V(L_{a}) = \gamma_{a} V(X_{a}) + (1-\gamma_{a}) V(Y_a)$$
- Two simple lottery tickets $L_a,L_b$ are a pair of ***k-standard lottery tickets** $(L_a,L_b)$* if (1) $\gamma_a=\gamma_b=\frac{1}{2}$, and (2) have a common value on the first consumption path $x_{ak}=x_{bk}=x_k$.
- Two simple lottery tickets $L_a,L_b$ are a pair of ***k-normal lottery tickets** $\langle L_a,L_b\rangle$* if (1) $\gamma_a=\gamma_b=\frac{1}{2}$, and (2) have a common value on both consumption paths $x_{ak}=x_{bk}=y_{ak}=y_{bk}=z_k$.
# Characterization theorems
**Strong additivity axiom**: an individual's preference between two *k-standard lottery tickets* in a given pair is independent of the level of $x_k$ for all pairs of k-standard lotteries, and all choice of $k$.
- If $V(L_a(x_k))>V(L_b(x_k))$ for some $x_k$, then $V(L_a(x_k'))>V(L_b(x_k'))$ for all $x_k'$.

> Thm 1. An individual's *preferences* satisfy the *strong additive axiom* if and only if his von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function is **additive**.
> - *proof sketch*: construct two consumption paths, and differentiate the utility functions with repect to $k$.This gives an equation showing that $\partial V(X) / \partial x_k$ depends only on $x_k$. The necessity part is trivial.

**Weak additivity axiom**: an individual's preference between two *k-normal lottery tickets* in a given pair is independent of the level of $z_k$ for all pairs of k-normal lotteries, and all choice of $k$.
- If $V(L_a(z_k))>V(L_b(z_k))$ for some $z_k$, then $V(L_a(z_k'))>V(L_b(z_k'))$ for all $z_k'$.
- Weak additivity axiom is weaker in the sense that, it restricts preference on *k-normal lotteries*, which is a **subset** of *k-standard lotteries*.

> Thm 2. An individual's *preferences* satisfy the *weak additive axiom* if and only if his von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function is **additive** or **log-additive**.
> - proof sketch: to show the suficient condition, a lemma points out (by construction) that weak additivity implies ordinally additive property. By differentiating two indifferent consumption paths with respect to $x_k$, we can show that $H'(V)=G''(S)/G'(S)=c$ is a constant. This shows that $G$ must be a linear or exponential transformation.
## Implications for sequential decision making
Consider the preference satisfying weak additivity axiom:
$$V(x_1,...,x_T)=G(\sum\limits_{t=1}^{T}v^t(x_t)),$$
where $G$ is a linear or exponential transformation. 
- A single choice is made between different *streams* of income
- **Q**: why should the decision maker considers reward in each period **independently**.
