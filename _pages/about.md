I am currently an PhD student at Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University. My research interest is mainly focuesed on decision making under risk and uncertainty, and also computational models of other aspects of human cognition and behaviour. I'm also enthusiastic about algorithmic music composition (AIGC, etc.).
